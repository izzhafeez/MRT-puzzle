# MRT-puzzle

Your train-loving friend is travelling to Singapore for the first time and wants to visit all the MRT interchanges (shown in the picture). However, he does not want to visit or pass through any station more than once. Furthermore, he wants to take each non-LRT (non-grey) train line exactly 3 distinct times during the journey. Can you help plan his route?

Assumptions:

You may only use the network and stations shown in the picture.
Two uses of the same line are considered distinct if they are separated by the use of another line.
The extensions to the Green and Yellow line connect to their main lines at Tanah Merah and Promenade respectively (i.e. it is impossible to travel from Bayfront to Dhoby Ghaut on the Yellow line without first passing through Promenade). Furthermore, Bedok to Tanah Merah to Expo constitutes one usage of the Green line.
